# Quake Log Parser

This project is a solution to a [technical challenge from CloudWalk](https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/704a555a0fe475ae0284ad9088e203f1). The task involves parsing a Quake 3 Arena log file, extracting and grouping game data.

The Quake Log Parser reads a log file generated by a Quake 3, processes the data to group information by matches and collects kill data. Additionally, it generates a detailed report for each match, including player rankings and the means by which players were killed.

## Get started

To get started with the Quake Log Parser, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikedoouglas/cloudwalk-challenge.git
   cd cloudwalk-challenge

2. **Set up your environment:** 

Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

## Usage

To run the log parser:

1. Prepare the log file: Make sure the Quake log file is available and its path is correctly set in the `.env` file (see Configuration).

2. **Run the parser:**
    ```bash
    go run cmd/parser/main.go
    ```
3. **View the output:** The parser will generate a detailed report in the console, showing grouped match information, player rankings, and kill statistics.

4. **Running the unit tests:** 
    ```bash
    go test ./internal/parser
    ```

## Configuration
The project uses environment variables to manage the configuration. To set up the environment:

1. **Duplicate the `.env.example` file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. **Configure your environment:**
Open the `.env` file and set the appropriate values for your environment. This typically includes setting the path to the log file.
    ```bash
    LOG_FILE_PATH=files/qgames.log
    WORLD_TAG=<world>
    ```
